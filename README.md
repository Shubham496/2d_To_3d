# 2d_To_3d
converting 2D image to 3D mesh using, image and dense map


# guide- 
import cv2 and numpy 
import your image and set path to it, 
use our multiplication function to get the cordinate and face of mesh -
pass depth map
pass image
1. set scale of multipliction (height) with depth map
2. set scale of multiplicatin with image (keeping the information)
3. set depth threshhold- (how much background you want?)
